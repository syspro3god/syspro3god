<h1>Fan Fiction</h1>
Cesc and I sat down on separate couches facing each other. I could see by the way he sat down and sighed heavily that he didn’t even know what to say. I gave him a small encouraging smile.<br>

“Jade was offered a job at Real Madrid,” he said helplessly his head in his hands.<br><br>

“How do you know?” I asked shocked. There were also some other emotions, I didn’t want to feel them but I did.<br> I was annoyed and hurt. This must have been what was on Jade’s mind and she didn’t tell me, she told him.<br><br>

“It doesn’t matter,” he said, “She can’t go,” he said as if it was final.<br><br><br>
      “It’s our rival club, your enemy Ronaldo plays there?” I asked him still not believing what he was saying. He gave me a small smile.<br>

“Ronaldo is not my enemy, he’s my rival,” he said simply, “He’s not actually that bad.”<br><br>

“And Xavi, Iniesta and the other’s have friends in that team,” he said and I still could not fathom what he was saying. Cesc had just said no, he didn’t even let me explain. Leo who was the star of the club was telling me to consider it?<br><br>
      
      I couldn’t believe the players were on our side but at the same time I didn’t know what my friends were going to say. We all said we’d keep it a secret and by now I’m almost sure the whole team knew. The thing we had to be careful of who said what. I couldn’t have Leo or Cesc showing what I do, that would just add more fuel to the fire. Ultimately we needed Xavi or Puyol. <br><br>
      
      Gerard chuckled. “You know I am” he mused softly “I know we’ve been speaking almost every day, but this…I’ve missed you,insisted as he pulled back a little, his blue eyes searching her face.<br>

Riley smiled up at him happily for a second before she pushed herself up onto her toes, pressing a soft kiss against his lips. “I’ve missed you too” she murmured softly.</div>
