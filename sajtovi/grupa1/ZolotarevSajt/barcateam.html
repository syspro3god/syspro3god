<h1>Anthem</h1>

The song was written in 1974 as part of Barcelona's 75th Anniversary Celebrations.<br>The lyrics are by Jaume Picas and Josep M. Espinàs and it is set to the music of Manuel Valls Gorina
On November 27, <br>1974,and as part of the Club's 75th Anniversary celebrations, 'Cant del Barça', was solemnly sung for the first time by<br>3,500voices conducted by Oriol Martorell.<br><br><br> Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper<br>, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto<br> "Més que un club" (More than a club).
